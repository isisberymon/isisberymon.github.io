        <p>Any artificial intelligence professional will tell you a neural network is modeled after the human brain. But whose exactly? This set of cards is an argument for the importance of diversity of thought in the face of generative AI.</p>

        <h4>the project brief</h4>
        <p>We were tasked with using the iconic Eames' House of Cards deck to tell a non-linear story on the topic of AI. Through this medium, readers can use the physical cards to weigh two arguments against eachother and (literally!) construct their own viewpoint.</p>
        <p>I interviewed my peers at CMU about their habits, comforts, friendships, and thoughts around neurodivergency. These responses were juxtaposed with the diagnostic criteria for conditions like autism, ADHD, and OCD, with an introduction on AI from Rijul Gupta, CEO of DeepMedia. My goal was for a reader to think critically about neurodivergent traits manifest in the real world and contribute to the diversity of humankind, something AI lacks.</p>
        <p>This piece was showcased alongside my peers in a pop-up exhibition we named artificial:___, showcasing how each of our topics and interests interact with AI.</p>

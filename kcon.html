        <h4>ideating </h4>
        <p>KCON is the worldâ€™s largest fan celebration of Korean pop culture. It's made for fans to explore fun panels, meet & greets, and star-studded concerts with their favorite idols.This convention is a fun space that prioritizes fan and idol interactions. Rather than celebrities, idols should be seen as friends that are coming along for the ride. KCON LA 2024 will take place on July 27th & 28th at the LA Convention Center and Crypto.com Arena.</p>

        <p>Since KCON alters its own brand every year and the visual trends of the industry can change overnight, it seemed like the perfect event to rebrand. To tap into the parasocial nature of the con, this rebrand builds off exisitng fun and cute concepts like YENA's Smartphone, STAYC's Teddy Bear, and ATEEZ's Illusion. This way, KCON aligns with the established visual language of the k-pop industry while still being new, fresh, and inviting.</p>

        <p>Colors and icons were made with possible convention lineups in mind. Color names like "In Bloom" and sticker-like icons such as microphones and stars reference popular songs and idols in recent history. These logos, icons, and colors can be used interchangeably, made to fit any group's visual concept and performance. This customizability lets each piece of promotional material and merchandise to be unique yet cohesive.
